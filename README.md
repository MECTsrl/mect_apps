# mect\_apps
Mect Apps: the Mect Suite example applications (HMI, PLC) (mect\_suite\_3.0 branch)

Some application examples (both HMI and PLC) are bound to the Mect Suite software: those examples are useful for describing the system features.

For using the example you need to:
1. create a "mect_apps" folder in C:\
2. copy the example tree in C:\mect_apps\

For each project:
- folder project\ contains the HMI graphic application, open in QtCreator the file "project.pro"
- folder project\plc contains the PLC application, use ATCMcontrol Engineering, from QtCreator "MecSuite/Crosstable" view

The application examples are sorted in folders according to the target models: TP1043, TPAC1007, TPAC1008 â€¦ and in AnyTPAC the generic ones.
